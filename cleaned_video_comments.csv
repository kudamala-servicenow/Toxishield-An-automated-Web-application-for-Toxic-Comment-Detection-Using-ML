@rajshedge,bro can you please make a video on how to update to latest python versions on anaconda like on spyder and jupyter notebook. As the spyder and jupyter notebook get the updates but the python version remains the same it does not get updated to latest version. Thank you for the video though i really appreciate your efforts and thank you for mysql video too.🤝,1,2023-06-12T19:49:23Z
